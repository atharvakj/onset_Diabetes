Number of Instances: 768.
Number of Attributes: 8 plus class.
For Each Attribute: (all numeric-valued)
  1.Number of times pregnant.
  2.Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test.
  3.Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
  4.Triceps skin fold thickness (mm).
  5.2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).
  6.Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2).
  7.Diabetes pedigree function.
  8.Age (years).
Class variable (0 or 1).

# ALgorithms used:
1. Random Forest based Decision Tree
2. AdaBoost based Decision Tree
3. Neural Net
4. Nearest Neighbors
5. Decision Tree
6. Linear SVM 

# Results:
Linear SVM performed better than all the other with a close call with Adaboost based Decision Tree,
Neural Net was the worst performer.
